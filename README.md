## 🌌 The Concept

Time famously flies. **Perspective - Live** renders time as a precise, modular grid of geometry, delivering a frequent dose of perspective at a glance.

### 🔭 Macro (Life Calendar)

Your life clock on your lock screen.

- **The Grid**: Each unit represents **one year**.
- **The Goal**: Visualize how much life you have lived versus what you might have left.

### 🚀 Micro (Day Counter)

Focus energy on the immediate future.

- **The Grid**: Each unit represents **one day**.
- **The Modes**:
  - **"There is no tomorrow"**: Single visible shape for today (breathing animation).
  - **"You vs. You (yesterday)"**: Two visible shapes — one for today (breathing) and one for yesterday.
  - **"Custom"**: Goal and deadline tracking across custom date ranges.
- **Health Connect Integration**: Link daily physical effort directly into the grid.
  - **Metrics**: Track **Steps**, **Calories**, **Distance**, or **Sleep**.
  - **Visualization**: Past days automatically map fill opacity to goal progress while the current day pulses. An optional typographic overlay displays raw metric values inside the shapes.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Deep Customization

Customize the aesthetic via the built-in **Style** sheet:

- **Shape Shifting**: Choose between **Circle**, **Rounded Square**, or **Rhombus** (rotated square).
- **Density Control**: Adjust grid scale from **0.5x** (airy, minimalist) to **1.0x** (dense, data-rich).
- **Container Padding**: Fine-tune margins around the grid for device bezels.
- **Colors**: 14 curated paired themes (*Iconic*, *Nordic Minimal*, *Warm Sand*, *Glacial Peak*, *Rose Quartz*, *Monochrome Zen*, *Sumi & Cinnabar*, *Boreal Forest*, *Sahara Dunes*, *Kyoto Celadon*, *Alpenglow*, *Basalt & Ochre*, *Pacific Drift*, *Terracotta Courtyard*), the generative *Atmosphere* theme producing unique daily palettes via perceptual Oklch color math, and dedicated Health Connect presets.
- **Daily Rotation**: Automatically cycle through rotatable color schemes daily at midnight over a 14-day cycle, or select *Atmosphere* for infinite, unrepeatable daily procedural palettes.
- **Material You**: Dynamic wallpaper color extraction on supported Android versions.

### ✒️ Typography

- **Geist**: Bundled directly into core resources to ensure crisp typography for health metrics and overlays across devices.

### ⚡ Performance

- **Zero Idle Drain**: Rendering engine pauses completely when the wallpaper is not visible.
- **Native Rendering**: Canvas-based rendering with pre-allocated geometry for fluid animations.
